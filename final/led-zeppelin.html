    Formed out of the ashes of The Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin were a english rock band formed in 1968. They are often credited with paving the way for the heavy metal genre and in the opinion of some were the first band to play such music, though that is open for much debate, mainly due to the variety of their sound.
